Tool to make enhanced screenshots. Inspired on LightShot

## How it works

With this tool you can select some rectangle on your screen and then draw on it like you can do on LightShot.

### Key binding resizing

Whenever you crop a screenshot you can move or resize it with the arrow keys.
- If you press these keys with `Shift` (no matter which shift) it will enter resize mode.
- If you press these keys with `Control` (no matter wich control) it will do resizing or moving every 10 pixels.

Whenever you're drawing with any draw tool you can update its stroke thickness pressing `Control` and moving the mouse wheel or with the keys `+` and `-`

### Drawing tools
With this application, like LightShot you can draw lines, arrows, rectangles inside the screenshot and those graphics will get merged with the screenshot whenever you're saving or uploading the image.

### Eye dropper tool
With this tool you can select a color from the screenshot you took with the help of a magnifier.
If you press `Shift` key when clicking a pixel to pick a color it will copy the hexadecimal color value to you clipboard.
